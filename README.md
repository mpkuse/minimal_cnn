# A minimal Implementation of CNN


I implemented a basic 3 layers network with convolution layers,
max-pooling. Also implemented the back-prop myself. 

The basic objective was to understand at the core how convolutional
networks work. I used cifar10 for 10-category classification


## Note
This implementation might not run as you expect. 
To get this working start from cnn_main.m. You need to download the
cifar10 dataset and put it into data folder
